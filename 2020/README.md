#Hero Jr 2020 project

Added a Raspberry PI 3B+, running MQTT broker, using serial to mqtt and a Arduino Mega Clone.  
The Raspberry PI will also have voice commands, the mega is used to control the keypad, ultrasonic, leds, ect and uses MQTT to communicate.  
LEDs were replaced with neopixels.  

jul22code_a_ is latest version of code.  
Everything is still a work in progress and needs more testing.
