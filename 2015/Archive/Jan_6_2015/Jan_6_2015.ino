At this point, a lot more of the code needs to be written, but all of the

/*Hero Jr Control - Arduino Mega
Commands:
key() - read a button push from the keypad
ping() - read distance from ping sensor
led(#) - turn on led # 0 to 7 state is toggled on or off
forward(distance) - move forward 
reverse(distance) - move backward
left(degree) - turn to the left 
right(degree) - turn to the right
light() - read the light sensor
volt() - check the voltage levels for the drive battery
test() - test leds, speech, drive motor, turning motor, ultrasonic, voltage, light
rinit() - reset Arduino Mega board to power on conditions
listen() - returns when it hears a sound (Signal Wire hooks up to pin 53 on the Mega. Sound sensor works at 5v)
speak(string) - string of what to say
speakint(int) - say an int number by converting it to a string
speakcmd(command) - gives a way to change the speech output
singhbd() - sing Happy Birthday
singdaisy() - sing Daisy


*** Voltage Sensor Information
This seems to work 3.3v hooked to output side
and "S" hooked to Analog input 1
It qives whole numbers as output
Tested on the UNO, and not sure why it needs "Wire.h"

Just for run ** New Command: 
cylon(times) - will cause the leds to cycle back and forth the number of times given

More Functions to add relating to the Keypad:
sing - mapped to key 4 - randomly sign one of three songs 
play - mapped to key 5 - not sure what this did
help - mapped to key 6 - 
speak - mapped to key 7 - 
gab - mapped to key 8 -
poet - mapped to key 9 - tells a random poem (one of three)
demo - mapped to key A - not sure yet
guard - mapped to key B - random move, using ultra sonic and drive
alarm - mapped to key C - Using PIR or Ultrasonic to watch something and make sure it doesn't move - if it does sound alarm (probably loud speech)
plan - mapped to key D - not sure what this does
setup - mapped to key E - 
enter - mapped to key F - enter key
