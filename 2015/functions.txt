 key() - read a button push from the keypad (wait 30ish seconds for keypress returns keypressed)
 ping() - read distance from ping sensor returns a distance in inches
 led(#) - turn on led # 0 to 7 state is toggled on or off
 forward(distance) - move forward 
 reverse(distance) - move backward
 left(degree) - turn servo to the left - this will make the robot turn to the right
 right(degree) - turn servo to the right - this will make the robot turn to the left
 light() - read the light sensor returns a vaule for the light sensor (high number less light, low number lots of light, normal light depends on room around 600 maybe)
 volt() - check the voltage levels for the drive battery returns whole number of volts (operating voltages should be above 10volts)
test() - test leds, speech, drive motor, turning motor, ultrasonic, voltage, light (may have turned into the test2 function)
rinit() - reset Arduino Mega board to power on conditions (*resetFunc?)
 listen() - returns when it hears a sound (Signal Wire hooks up to pin 53 on the Mega. Sound sensor works at 5v) return a 1 if sound detected, or 0 if no sound
 speak(string) - string of what to say
 speakint(int) - say an int number by converting it to a string
 speakcmd(command) - gives a way to change the speech output ** needs to be rewritten for use with the nano microcontroller **
 singhbd() - sing Happy Birthday  ** Test with the nano microcontroller **
 singdaisy() - sing Daisy ** Needs to be rewritten for use with the nano microcontroller **
 guess() - Guess the Number between 0 and 999 game (not done)
 keytest() - test the keypad

*resetFunc()
